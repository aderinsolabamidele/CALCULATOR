# CALCULATOR
This calculator is a simple web-based calculator implemented using Python and Flask for the backend, and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend.

Features:

Basic Arithmetic Operations: Users can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Graphical Interface: The calculator has a graphical interface with buttons for each digit and operation.
Real-Time Calculation: As users click on the buttons, the input is displayed in real-time, and the result is calculated instantly.
Error Handling: Division by zero and other invalid operations are handled gracefully.
Implementation:

Flask Backend: Flask is used to handle routing and request processing. When a user visits the homepage ('/' route), they are presented with the calculator interface. When they perform a calculation ('/calculate' route), Flask processes the input, performs the calculation, and returns the result.
HTML/CSS/JavaScript Frontend: The calculator interface is created using HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity. Buttons are created for each digit and operation, and JavaScript functions handle appending digits to the display, clearing the display, and performing calculations.

Overall, this calculator provides a simple yet interactive way for users to perform basic arithmetic operations directly from their web browser.
